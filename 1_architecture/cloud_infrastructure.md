Cloud Infrsturtcure Consideration-

Buisness Context:

Currently, Digital Health has their own servers that hold confidential patient data, which are running in a dedicated room at their own office and are maintained by their own team. They need to buy new machines but are unsure how much they should invest to be able to serve future customers. They want to be able to serve all potential customers, but at the same time keep costs reasonable. Additionally, since Digital Health deals with patient data, they need to make sure that sensitive patient data is not on the cloud. This means that Digital Health will need to keep on-premise data centers and only upload non-sensitive information to the cloud.

Consultation:

A valid reason for Digital Health to start using cloud would be if Digital Health plans to experiment on a new type of service and is unsure if that service will ever be useful in production. This is a good example of how cloud services can be used. In cloud, the infrastructure costs must be paid only as long as an experiment goes on. It would be much slower and much more expensive to buy new hardware for a short experiment.

One option for using cloud is where the system is running partly in the cloud and partly on servers owned by Digital Health. This would allow Digital Health’s own servers to be combined with resources in the cloud. It does not have to be strictly either own servers or the cloud, there are ways to use them together.

Digital Health can't store the majority of their data in the cloud because they have sensitive patient data, and according to Swedish law that data cannot be hosted on the cloud, only non-sensitive data can be stored in the cloud.

To understand if the database they need in the cloud should be IaaS or PaaS a key difference to note is that with PaaS you have a selection of databases to choose from, and the platform takes care of database software and updates. With IaaS you only get virtual machines, where you install whatever you want, but also need to take care of all updates. In short, with IaaS you install the database software yourself and with PaaS it is installed for you.

When finally comparing and choosing a cloud service provider there are many questions to be asked and factors to be considered. One of which is the providers location. For example, if latency needs to keep close to the data of the system in a certain country or area, the location of a cloud provider’s data centre could be the most important criterion for decision.
