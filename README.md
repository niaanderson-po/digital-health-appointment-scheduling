Accenture's Consulting Developer Team is working to optimize the user experience of the app, Digital Health. The app is used by medical patients to book appointments and track medical information. Currently, a lot of patients find the Digital Health app to be buggy, unreliable, difficult to use, and prone to errors. The biggest issues seem to be that the process for making an appointment is slow, people are being kicked off the app and it's difficult to get clarity on the bookings due to errors and/or missing information, which the Digital Health employees are struggling to cope with.

Within Accenture's Software Engineering Virtual Experience, I contribute to four key areas: Architecture, Security, Programming, and Testing.

These contirbutions, ultimately, work towards the solution to the Digital Health app.
