NIST CyberSecurity Framework-

Five tools that help stay on top of security threats and enhance our ability to detect attacks:

Identify: Taking inventory of everything we need to protect, like our assets and potential risks. It's about understanding what we have and what could go wrong.

Protect: Safeguarding what was identified to protect. It's like putting locks on our doors or passwords on our computers – making sure our valuable stuff stays safe.

Detect: Set up systems and tools to spot any potential security issues before they become big problems. This is all about keeping an eye out for trouble.

Respond: It's about quickly analyzing the situation and taking action to minimize any damage when there’s a security incident. Like putting out a fire before it spreads.

Recover: This is about getting back on our feet after a security incident. We work on returning things to normal so we can keep operating smoothly.

Five tiers to gauge cybersecurity effectiveness:

Tier 0: does not exist

Tier 1: ad-hoc or heavily relying on individual's knowledge

Tier 2: decentralized or there are only informal processes

Tier 3: company-wide, documented processes

Tier 4: innovative technologies in use, proactive review and development
